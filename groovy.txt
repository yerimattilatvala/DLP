Groovy

a)
    -Compiler : Groovy compiler version 2.4.5
    .System: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

b)
    Groovy is an object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. Also support
    imperative programming,offers functional programming features and can be used as 
    scripting language which is dynamically compiled to Java virtual machine bytecode(this will produce a MyClass.class file).
    Groovy features include both static and dynamic typing, static compiling(since version 2) and
    have automatic memory management (garbage collector).
c)
    *Advantages:
        -Groovy support imperative programming which make us able to do the iterative methods.
        -The memory management is done automatically by the Groovy memory manager which release 
          us from explicit management of the memory.
        -Poderiamos po√±er que ao estar desarrollado sobre Java podiamos haber aprobeitado este lenguaje para facer os metodos
        iterativos en groovy e despois integralos en Java ? (No caso de que fixeramos a implementacion en java digo)
	*Disadvantages:
        -Because Groovy is a programming language for the Java platform does not allow the creation of custom data types 
         and because of that the custom type is made by objects. 
d)
    -As we previously said we were forced to use a class and objects to be faithful to original implementation.
    -In the deleted function which defines a function inside, we were forced to remove the function because Groovy syntax 
    does not allow declaring functions within others. 
    -The error function of the original implementation no longer exists in the Groovy implementation due to the automatic memory management of Groovy.
